## What Is This?
Do you have a dream you want to accomplish but you can't seem to get anywhere with it?  Have you tried keeping a journal of your efforts?  Sometimes it takes the act of seeing your successes and stumbles to fully apprecriate what you've done.

## Rules
The rules are simple and straightforward, fork this repo to start your journal.  Then every day you work on accomplishing your dream you write an entry in your log.  Be as deatiled as you want, it's up to you.  You can share your log and what you've learned by using #ImproveMyself.
