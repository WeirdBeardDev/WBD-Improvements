Kerbal Space Program was on sale and had a free trial for the next 3 days.  I've had it on my wishlist for quite some time and decided now was a good time to test it out.  I found the game well made, however, I don't have the time to invent in learning how to play.  Before I could even do basic items I had to take two training courses and even then I consulted the Internet to figure out how to complete two contracts.  If I had a dozen or so free hours a week I could invest in learning the game I would have bought it.  Alas, that's not what I want to focus on.  As it is I spent my time testing the game instead of working on my game.
